### Abstract

### Highlight

The main advantage of the FVAR approach can be illustrated by the following graph:

![Distributional Effects of Tax Cuts](/images/fvar_highlight.png)

Here, I plot the impulse responses of *income density functions* to unexpected tax cuts. It shows that following a tax cut

- there is a decrease in the share of lower-middle-class households 

- the majority of this share decrease is offset by increases in the upper range of the distribution

- the share of households at the left tail also increases, but with smaller magnitude

Overall, it suggests that lower-middle-class households are better off, but policymaker need to pay extra attention to the left tail.

The distributional effects give **different** policy implication than conventional methods, e.g., using Gini coefficients as summary statistics:

- we will find that **Gini coefficients increase following tax cuts**, raising inequality concern

- but the above graph shows that the increases in Gini coefficients are mechanical, resulting from a shrinking lower-middle-class
  - remember, most of this share decrease is compensated for by the increase in the richer range
