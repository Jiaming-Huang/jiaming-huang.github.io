The main findings of this project can be summarized by the following graph:

![Wage Cyclicality Summary](/images/wr_sum.png)

Here, "risks" are defined based on the cyclical responses of wage to aggregate fluctuations.

- Production workers at single-layer firms are the most vulnerable, experiencing significant wage decreases during recessions but only minimal increases during economic booms.

- Executives, on the contrary, enjoy substantial pay raises in prosperous times but endure little, if any, reduction during economic downturns.

- Conventional wisdom suggests that workers benefit from moving to larger firms. However, this is not always true, because of **interactions among workers within the same firm**.

   - When the managerial workers are more powerful, wage changes at the bottom layer are more left-skewed
